# Machine Learning Project: Predicting Student Adaptability Level in Online Education using K-means

Welcome to the repository for the Machine Learning project focused on building a K-means model to predict the adaptability level of students in online education. This project aims to explore and apply machine learning techniques to understand how students adapt to the online learning environment.

## Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using the K-means algorithm. The model aims to categorize students into different groups based on their behavior and performance in online education environments. These categories can be used to identify patterns and provide insights into improving the learning experience for different student profiles.
